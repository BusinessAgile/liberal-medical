* This is an attempt to create invoices from medical appointments. 
* The actual process is to create an invoice with one line (the consultation in medical_appointment) which can be invoiced at single unit or by hours.
  * We can also create what we called an "Appointment Cluster" that group many appointment with the same consultation service.
* The patient is automatically invoiced by passing appointment status to Done or Absent. 
  * This will be configurable in the future.
* The final process is to merge this with OCA/vertical-medical
